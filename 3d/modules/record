You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.
        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.
        The maximum height of the structure is 3 layers.

        Observations (Top View - shows 1 if ANY layer has a block at that position):
        
Top view:
0 0 0
0 0 0
1 0 0


Task: Infer a valid 3D structure (grid 3x3, up to 3 layers) that matches the top view(s).
Constraints:
- Layer 1 is the bottom layer and must not be all zeros.
- Every block at layer z>1 must be supported by a block directly below (same (r,c)).
- No unnecessary empty layers at bottom or top.
- Total height <= 3.

Output format (strict, no extra text):

        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 1 prior attempts shown above

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.
        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)

        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"

        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 8 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 11 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]

        ...
        (continue for all layers needed, up to maximum 3 layers)
        
        Example of CORRECT output format for a 3x3 grid:

        Note: This represents a 3x3x2 structure where:
        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)
        4. Don't exceed 3 layers in height
        

        You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 13 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        Layer 2:
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        (continue for all layers needed, up to maximum 3 layers)
        
        Example of CORRECT output format for a 3x3 grid:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:
        1 0 1
        0 0 0
        1 0 1
        Layer 2:
        1 0 0
        0 0 0
        0 0 1
        
        Note: This represents a 3x3x2 structure where:
        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)
        4. Don't exceed 3 layers in height
        

        You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.
        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.
        The maximum height of the structure is 3 layers.

        Structure:
        Layer 1:
        1 0 1
        0 0 0
        1 0 1

        1 0 0
        0 0 0
        0 0 1
        
        Note: This represents a 3x3x2 structure where:
        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)
        4. Don't exceed 3 layers in height
        

        You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.
        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.
        The maximum height of the structure is 3 layers.

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 13 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        Layer 2:
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        (continue for all layers needed, up to maximum 3 layers)
        
        Example of CORRECT output format for a 3x3 grid:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:
        1 0 1
        0 0 0

        0 0 0
        0 0 1
        
        Note: This represents a 3x3x2 structure where:
        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)
        4. Don't exceed 3 layers in height
        

        You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.
        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.
        The maximum height of the structure is 3 layers.

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 13 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        Layer 2:
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        (continue for all layers needed, up to maximum 3 layers)
        
        Example of CORRECT output format for a 3x3 grid:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:
        1 0 1
        0 0 0
        1 0 1
        Layer 2:
        1 0 0
        0 0 0
        0 0 1
        
        Note: This represents a 3x3x2 structure where:
        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)
        4. Don't exceed 3 layers in height
        

        You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.
        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.
        The maximum height of the structure is 3 layers.

        You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.
        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.
        The maximum height of the structure is 3 layers.

        Observations (Top View - shows 1 if ANY layer has a block at that position):
        
Top view:

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]

        Layer 2:
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        (continue for all layers needed, up to maximum 3 layers)
        
        Example of CORRECT output format for a 3x3 grid:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:

        1 0 0
        0 0 0
        0 0 1
        
        Note: This represents a 3x3x2 structure where:
        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 3 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 8 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]

        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)
        4. Don't exceed 3 layers in height
        

        You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 8 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]

        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        (continue for all layers needed, up to maximum 3 layers)
        
        Example of CORRECT output format for a 3x3 grid:

        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)
        4. Don't exceed 3 layers in height
        

        You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.
        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 9 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        Layer 2:
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        (continue for all layers needed, up to maximum 3 layers)
        
        Example of CORRECT output format for a 3x3 grid:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:
        1 0 1
        0 0 0

        1 0 0
        0 0 0
        0 0 1
        
        Note: This represents a 3x3x2 structure where:
        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)
        4. Don't exceed 3 layers in height
        

        You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.
        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.
        The maximum height of the structure is 3 layers.

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 10 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        Layer 2:
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        (continue for all layers needed, up to maximum 3 layers)
        
        Example of CORRECT output format for a 3x3 grid:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:
        1 0 1
        0 0 0
        1 0 1
        Layer 2:
        1 0 0
        0 0 0
        0 0 1
        
        Note: This represents a 3x3x2 structure where:
        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)
        4. Don't exceed 3 layers in height
        

        You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.
        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.
        The maximum height of the structure is 3 layers.

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 12 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Note: This represents a 3x3x2 structure where:
        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)
        4. Don't exceed 3 layers in height
        

        You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.
        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 13 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 14 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        Layer 2:
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        (continue for all layers needed, up to maximum 3 layers)
        
        Example of CORRECT output format for a 3x3 grid:
        Structure:

        0 0 0
        0 0 1
        
        Note: This represents a 3x3x2 structure where:
        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)
        4. Don't exceed 3 layers in height
        

        You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.
        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.
        The maximum height of the structure is 3 layers.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)

        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 2 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 2 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        Layer 2:
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        (continue for all layers needed, up to maximum 3 layers)
        
        Example of CORRECT output format for a 3x3 grid:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:
        1 0 1
        0 0 0
        1 0 1
        Layer 2:
        1 0 0
        0 0 0
        0 0 1
        
        Note: This represents a 3x3x2 structure where:
        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)
        4. Don't exceed 3 layers in height
        

        You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.
        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.
        The maximum height of the structure is 3 layers.

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)

        ...
        (continue for all layers needed, up to maximum 3 layers)

        Note: This represents a 3x3x2 structure where:
        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)

        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"

        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.
        The maximum height of the structure is 3 layers.

        Observations (Top View - shows 1 if ANY layer has a block at that position):

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 1 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)

        Note: This represents a 3x3x2 structure where:
        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 1 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]

        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:

        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"

        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.
        The maximum height of the structure is 3 layers.

        Observations (Top View - shows 1 if ANY layer has a block at that position):

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)

        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"

        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)

        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 1 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]

        ...
        (continue for all layers needed, up to maximum 3 layers)
        
        Example of CORRECT output format for a 3x3 grid:

        0 0 0
        0 0 1
        
        Note: This represents a 3x3x2 structure where:
        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)
        4. Don't exceed 3 layers in height
        

        You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.
        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 2 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]

        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)

        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 2 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]

        Layer 2:
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        (continue for all layers needed, up to maximum 3 layers)
        
        Example of CORRECT output format for a 3x3 grid:
        Structure:

        0 0 0
        0 0 1
        
        Note: This represents a 3x3x2 structure where:
        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)
        4. Don't exceed 3 layers in height
        

        You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.
        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.

        You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.
        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.
        The maximum height of the structure is 3 layers.

        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Note: This represents a 3x3x2 structure where:
        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 2 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        4. Don't exceed 3 layers in height
        

        You are given observations of a 3D structure made of unit blocks on a 3x3 grid.
        Each observation shows a view of the structure from a specific angle.
        The maximum height of the structure is 3 layers.

        Observations (Top View - shows 1 if ANY layer has a block at that position):
        
Top view:
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 1


Prior 3D structure generated (do not repeat if avoidable):

Attempt 1:
Layer 1:
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 1

Attempt 2:
Layer 1:
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 1
Layer 2:
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 1


        Task: Infer the complete 3D structure that could produce these observations.

        Structure specifications:
        - Grid size: 3x3
        - Maximum height: 3 layers
        - The structure consists of layers stacked from bottom to top, where each layer is a 3x3 grid with 0 (empty) or 1 (block).
        
        Important constraints:
        1. Layer 1 is the BOTTOM layer (ground level) - it should contain blocks, not be all zeros
        2. Blocks must be supported from below (a block at height h requires a block at height h-1 in the same position)
        3. Do not add unnecessary empty layers at the bottom or top
        4. Layers are numbered from bottom (Layer 1) to top (Layer N)
        5. Do not exceed the maximum height of 3 layers
        
        6. Generate a DIFFERENT valid structure from the 2 prior attempts shown above
        7. Two structures are considered equivalent if they have the same blocks in the same positions across all layers
        

        Provide your answer as a 3D structure with each layer specified.

        Output format:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:  (bottom layer - should contain at least one block)
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        Layer 2:
        [row 1 values separated by spaces]
        [row 2 values separated by spaces]
        ...
        (continue for all layers needed, up to maximum 3 layers)
        
        Example of CORRECT output format for a 3x3 grid:
        Structure:
        Layer 1:
        1 0 1
        0 0 0
        1 0 1
        Layer 2:
        1 0 0
        0 0 0
        0 0 1
        
        Note: This represents a 3x3x2 structure where:
        - Layer 1 (bottom) has blocks at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)
        - Layer 2 (top) has blocks at (0,0) and (2,2), both supported by blocks in Layer 1 below
        - Every '1' in Layer 2 has a '1' directly below it in Layer 1 (physical support requirement)
        - Uses spaces between digits (not commas or other separators)
        
        INCORRECT formats to avoid:
        1. Don't start with empty bottom layer: Layer 1 should contain blocks
        2. Don't use commas: "1,0,1" - use spaces instead: "1 0 1"
        3. Don't add blocks without support below them (physics violation)
        4. Don't exceed 3 layers in height
